#Description
This code book describes the variables in the data table output in the TidyOutput.txt file.

#Rows
Each row of the table corresponds to a unique subject and activity pair. Many rows in the original data were averaged to construct each row in the final output.

#Columns
The subject column contains an integer representing a unique human subject.

The activity column contains the name of one of six activities being performed by a subject:
    WALKING
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    SITTING
    STANDING
    LAYING

The remaining 66 columns each contain a different accelerameter measurement. More information about these variables can be found in the "UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt" file.
